            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE MOST Reverend father in God, his verie good Lord, IOHN, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence <hi>of God, Archbiſhop of Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, one of her Maiesties most honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Privie Counſell, Primate of all England and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitane.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N what ſort this land of ours was lately viſited by the hand of the Lorde for two yeares together with vnſeaſonable weather, &amp; ſo conſequently with ſome ſcarcitie then, although to ſay the truth it was nothing ſo grievous as heretofore our elders haue had, and others then felt, as it was reported: yet was it ſo evident and plaine in it ſelfe, that I ſhall not neede to ſtande to ſhew what it was, or how far we were all generally touched therewith: but eſpecially thoſe that were the poorer ſort among us. Our owne experience for that matter was
<pb facs="tcp:173383:3"/>ſuch, that whoſoever woulde goe about to make any farther demonſtration of it, might verie well ſpare his labour therein. But whereas in ſuch caſe ſome other way there is, wherein we might bee fruitfully occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to verie good purpoſe, and ſo as the nature of the thing it ſelfe doth require: therein whoſoever could rightly and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imploy his labour, he might be able there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to diſcharge ſome part of his duetie, and doe a peece of good ſervice to God, and his countrey.</p>
            <p>That other way I take to bee eſpecially this: that we acknowledge the ſame to bee ſent of God; and therewithall, that ſó we be touched therewith, as in ſuch caſe doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain. In which becauſe. I did not then know (nor yet doe) that others did labour, therefore the laſt yeare, I did endevour mee ſelf to ſet downe ſomewhat thereof: which alſo I finiſhed as is pleaſed the Lord to bleſſe me therein. And to the end that I might ſafelier doe it, without offending on either ſide, either on the right hand, or on the left, I ſawe no better way then to take ſome text of Scripture, ſuch as belonged to this kinde of argument, and out of it to derive ſome ſuch inſtruction as the text it ſelfe ſhoulde
<pb facs="tcp:173383:3"/>naturally yeeld. So did I take the Prophet Ioel, and out of him framed this Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, that thén I praeſented your Grace withall. But ſeeing that ſince it hath beene ſtayed (I wote not by what ſinister meanes) by one that undertooke the printing of it, &amp; now of late it is come to my hands again, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that in ſome reſpect it may ſeeme to come out of ſeaſon now: yet becauſe that in others it doth not (nor but little in that) I thought it my dutie again to praeſent your Grace therewith.</p>
            <p>Which thing the leſſe that it is in it ſelfe (in reſpect of any thing therin that is mine) the leſſe bould I ought to have beene, both at the firſt and now alſo to have offered the ſame, unto ſo grave and learned a cenſure. But ſeeing that it pleaſed your Grace to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it then; I might not turn it an other way now; especially, when as the nature of it in my iudgement is ſuch, as that before I thought mee ſelf bound, and yet do, in order and duetie to make it yours. And ſo beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching your Grace to pardon, both my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bouldnes therein, and the renuing of it now again, I humblie praie that Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God the father of lights &amp; only fountain of all good graces, of his great and infinite
<pb facs="tcp:173383:4"/>mercie, for the glorie of his holie name, and in the face of his Annointed, would vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe ſo to viſit us from above by his Holie Spirit, that we maie be in ſuch ſort touched, with this his gentle and gracious warning, and ſo ſeeke vnto him while it is time, that we provoke no heavier diſpleaſure, but maie attaine to his further mercies, and euer ſtand in his gracious fauour.

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Heras (gentle Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) this admoniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mine out of the Prophet Ioel was to haue come foorth the laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
<note place="margin">That this Prophecie fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, and theſe our daies mar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velous well.</note> though (I know not how) it hath beene ſtayed till this praeſent: by this meanes it cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, that now I am iuſtly oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned to ſay ſumwhat unto thee, not only of the Treatiſe it ſelfe, but alſo of this late publiſhing of it. Concerning the Treatiſe it ſelfe, although it be out of the Prophet Ioel, who was ſent of God to his people of old, and about ſuch things as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a ſpeciall eſtate of theirs thén: yet doth it ſo fitly agree with ús alſo now, and with the waies that are moſt common and rife among us that the ſelfe ſame Prophet may ſeeme as much to have beene preſerved for ús againſt this time that now we are in, as he was before ſent unto others to ſpeake unto thém. For we alſo are found in the ſelf ſame waies, that they were in at that praeſent: and therefore hath the Lord for theſe few of the laſt yeeres in much like ſort laide his hand vpon
<pb facs="tcp:173383:5"/>us, as he did upon them, and yet alſo doth, in very plaine and ſenſible maner. But as théy were ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and could not ſee it, &amp; therfore turned nor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord that ſo had laide his hand upon them: ſo wé likevviſe at this praeſent have notably beene provoked diuers waies to acknowledge the hand of God upon us, and to turne unto him, and yet notwithſtanding, we have not done it, but either ſhame with it, or thinke it needeles to take ſuch a courſe. And yet, as at that time God did but with one hand ſhake the rod at them, &amp; with the other held foorth ſpecial mercies vnto them, a further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of religion among them, and a ſpecial deliverance from al their enimies: ſo at this time alſo we may ſee the Lord to obſerve that courſe toward vs, not onely laying his hand upon us, but alſo tendering and offering unto us, by manie good and comfortable tokens, both a further manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the goſpel, and a better riddance of our eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, if ſo be that we can truely turn unto him. As therefore this call of the Prophet was to ſpeciall good uſe unto thém to quicken them up, both to a ſenſible feeling of that hand of God upon them; &amp; to caſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves to be in a redines to receave thoſe greater mercies at his hands likewiſe: even ſo may it be as much to our purpoſe, that he ſhould nowe ſtir us up unto a feeling of ſuch hands of God as are upon us; and with all diligence to ſort our ſelves to ſuch a courſe, as beſt may ſerve to take unto us thoſe other mercies, that now of long he hath of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto us, (&amp; yet doth) in ſo gracious maner.</p>
            <p>But it may be,
<note place="margin">In what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</note> that thou wilt thinke, that I have over lightly paſſed over the Text of this Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: yeelding, as it doth, ſo manie good leſſons; ſo meete for our ſelves, and for the daies wherein we live. But my deſire was, but only to open the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet unto thee; and that ſo briefly as I could: that ſo being otherwiſe leſſe incumbred, thou mighteſt
<pb facs="tcp:173383:5"/>the better attend unto him. For which cauſe alſo, after everie chiefe &amp; principal diviſion of the Text, and the opening of the Methode or order of it, I have briefly ſhewed, howe we may apply the ſame to our ſelves. Then alſo, to the end that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie one may better perceive, how far foorth he may account, either of the ſenſe that out of any part of the Text is gathered, or of the Methode whereinto it is digeſted, I have here ſet down the Text it ſelfe in ſuch ſort diſtributed, or divided into ſuch ſeverall portions as it is aportioned &amp; handled in the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it ſelf: noting alſo, in the end of every portion, in what Sections of the Treatiſe that portio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is hand<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led. A matter that many do litle need (ſuch as have the text already, and can redily turn unto it:) &amp; yet may it be to good uſe to ſome others, &amp; (for that matter) eaſe them of ſome part of their labour. And the brieflier and plainlier that it is delivered unto thee, the better ſhalt thou be able to ſee, what it is that the Prophet doth call thee unto. Which when thou perceaveſt, then it remayneth, that thou caſt thee ſelf to be in a redines to anſwere his cal.</p>
            <p>Concerning this late publiſhing of it; firſt,
<note place="margin">Of the late publishing of it: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſse, that yet alſo it cometh in ſeaſen.</note> what was the cauſe of the ſtay with him to who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the prin ting thereof was comitted, &amp; who then did under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the praeſent diſpatch of it, I mee ſelf am not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay: &amp; it was much againſt my wil, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that, as at that praeſent occaſion had ſet me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that kinde of labour for the good of others ſo did it likewiſe not well accord with that needles delay that thereof was made, when the time it ſelfe did ſo iuſtly require it. Inſomuch that to that verie end, that is, to give it ſo readie a courſe, as to that ſeaſon did appertain, both my ſelfe of ſet purpoſe repayred to London, and there tooke ſpeciall order for the praeſent imprinting of it. Then that it is ſet foorth now, although it may ſeeme to be ſumwhat our of ſeaſon, in ſome reſpect, becauſe it relieth

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this Prophecie of Ioel we haue firſt ſette downe the Title of it:
<note place="margin">The títle of it.</note> then the matter that is therein deliuered. The Title of it is ſet downe in the firſt verſe, and therein we are to conſider, not onely of ſuch things as are plainly ſet downe therein: but of ſomewhat alſo, that is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, &amp; yet notwithſtanding neede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be thought on and to be gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſo well as we may. That which is plainely ſet downe therein, reſteth in two principall points: that the matter following (in all this Prophecie) came from the Lord: and was deliuered vnto the people by the miniſterie of Ioel. In that it came from the Lorde, wee are to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:173383:15"/>eſteeme of it accordingly: and in that it pleaſeth God to vouchſafe us ſuch trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in earthly veſſels, thoſe whom hee u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth to ſuch a purpoſe, though they bee but ſeely things in them ſelues, yet ought they to be for this cauſe, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, ſo much the more welcome and deater unto us. That which is not expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there, is concerning the time wherein he prophecied: which notwithſtanding is to be gathered of us ſo well as we may, becauſe that otherwiſe the ſenſe of the Prophet muſt needes bee harder unto us: as alſo it is ſufficientlie knowen, that thát hath giuen a great part of the occaſion, that the Interpreters haue va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſo much in their iudgements there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">Firſt therefore to examine,
<note place="margin">The time vvhen hee propheci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Which is gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</note> what the time was wherein he prophecied, it ſeemeth to mee, that the iudgent of thoſe is clearely the beſt, that are of opinion, that he prophecied in the daies of Uzziah (otherwiſe called
<note n="a" place="margin">2. <hi>king</hi> 14:21.</note> Azariah) the king of Iudah: or, at leaſt, of Iotham his ſoon: and ſo conſequently apperteineth to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<note place="margin">Firſt by the placing of it.</note> and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein contained. As touching the placing of it, it is no more but this, that ſeeing that of old it is placed among thoſe, that, by good teſtimonie of the text it ſelfe belong to that time, (as <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeah, Amos,</hi> and <hi>Micah</hi> doe) therefore is it the moſt likelieſt that it appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to that time alſo: partly, for that the ſcriptures are ever lightly in that ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner digeſted: and partly for that
<note n="f" place="margin">
                  <hi>Hier. in Ioel.</hi> 1.</note> 
               <hi>Ierom</hi> himſelfe, by this argument alſo, was ſo perſwaded. The <hi>Septuagint</hi> I graunt did
<note n="g" place="margin">Idem in Proemio in Ioel.</note> Otherwiſe place it: but it ſeemeth they vſed the rule of <hi>Leſbos:</hi> placing it ſo, as they thought the interpretation thereof would require: and not eaſily yeelding that the ſenſe ſhoulde bee ſuch, as the place, that long before them it had, ſhould ſeeme to import. Otherwiſe it is ſomewhat ſtrange, that they ſhould ſo alter the placing of it: conſidering that it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:173383:16"/>is taken for
<note n="h" place="margin">
                  <hi>Idem in Praef. in</hi> 12. <hi>Prophetas.</hi>
               </note> a rule among the learned, that when there is no time noted of any of the Prophets, then doth that Prophet belong to the time of the Prophet that goeth before.
<note place="margin">Then by the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter therein conteined.</note> As touching the matter therein contained, it doth ſo fitly accord vnto that compaſſe of time, that in my iudgement, we may rather maruaile, that diuers there be of very good account in the Church of God (and worthily too) that did not ſee it: then that our ſelues neede to ſtand in doubt thereof. For not only the whole matter doth fitly agree, to that which was propounded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that doe vndoubtedly belong to that very time: but diuers ſpeciall things there are beſides, that doe ſufficiently warrant that ſo it did. Concerning the whole, becauſe that there can bee no iudgement thereof, til the matter it ſelfe be unfolded, therefore the credite of it is to await the ende of the treatiſe: and then, either to ſtand, or to fall, in the iudgement of the indifferent Reader,
<note place="margin">By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this our Prophet, and Iſaiah together.</note> without any further urging of it. Thoſe ſpeciall things that are beſides, I chiefly gather, out of the comparing of this Prophet of ours, and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> together: and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:173383:16"/>that in the firſt fiue Chapters only which are moſt likely, by
<note n="i" place="margin">1:1. <hi>and</hi> 6.1.</note> 
               <hi>Iſaiah</hi> himſelfe, to appertaine to the time that wee ſpeake of. For ſeeing that the ſecond time of his prophecying beginneth in the yeare that <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> died (as in the beginning of the ſixt Chapter it is recorded) and yet in the beginning of the firſt Chapter it is plainely ſet downe, that ſome part of his prophecie was uttered in the daies of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zziah</hi> while yet he liued: therefore may thoſe firſt Chapters of that his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecie be ſafely taken of us, if not as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly appertaining to that time (for
<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Calu. in Iſa.</hi> 6.1.</note> ſome haue beene of their minde, not thinking that the firſt fiue Chapters did appertaine to a former time, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of that which in the beginning of the ſixt Chapter is noted: but that in thoſe fiue Chapters going before is ſet downe howe he beganne to prophecie, and then the time more ſpecially noted in the beginning of the ſixt) yet as the moſt likely, becauſe it is the iudgement of moſt of the learned: and the opinion of thoſe others hath no ſuch warrant by the text it ſelfe, but rather is thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prooued. And that which we finde in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:173383:17"/>theſe fiue firſt Chapters of Iſaiah, ſo fitly agreeing to this Prophet of ours, doth partly he in thoſe things that they utter of the iudgementes of God: and partly in that which they doe both ſet downe as touching his mercy or fauoure towards them.
<note place="margin">Firſt in thoſe things that they utter of the iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</note> Thoſe things that they utter out of the iudgments of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, are two: firſt, a famine; then alſo, an armie. Concerning the famine, they doe not onely both ſpeake of it: but alſo doe it in much like maner.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:173383:17"/>the flamb brunt up the trees of the fielde, and the Riuers them ſelues were dried up: Iſaiah likewiſe in much like maner telleth them, that
<note n="q" place="margin">3:1.</note> the ſtay and the ſtrength of breade and water ſhould be taken from them: that the chiefe &amp; principall ſort of them ſhould be as
<note n="*" place="margin">5:13.</note> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed, and plainely confeſſe,
<note n="r" place="margin">3:7.</note> that they had neither breade, nor clothing: that

<note n="t" place="margin">5:24.</note> their roote ſhould be as rotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nes, and their bud riſe up like duſt: and that
<note n="v" place="margin">1:30; 31. 5:24.</note> they ſhould be as a garden that had no water, burnt and conſumed with fire, as tow, ſtuble, or chaffe. So that both doe ſpeake of a famine, &amp; both doe ſignifie both that it ſhalbe very great, &amp; that it ſhould, for a great part, come by immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate drought or heat (as alſo appeared by thoſe wormes that Ioel doth ſpeake of:) and yet it appeareth by Ioel alſo, that otherwiſe it came by ouer-much wet for a time, when their corne was firſt ſowne, becauſe he ſaith, as we heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that their corne was foyſty &amp; rotten under the clots. Concerning the army,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:173383:18"/>although it may very well bee, that the one doe meane a further matter then the other: yet they both ſet forth their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, in much like manner and forme of ſpeach for whereas this our Prophet ſaith

The uſe whereunto it might very wel ſerv, to haue ſuch a form of this their ſorrowing preſcribed unto them, ſeemeth to be, the more effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to frame them unto it: ſuch as ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing at all, to be provoked hereby to ſorrow ſomewhat: and ſuch as ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but in ſlender maner, to fal better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it, and to endeuour to get ſo neere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this as they could. The reaſons that the Prophet uſeth,
<note place="margin">The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why.</note> the better to ſtir them up unto it, are of two ſorts: ſome of them taken of the conſideration of the thing it ſelfe: and ſome, of certaine other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons touched therewith, The thing it ſelf, out of which the Prophet doth reaſon, is the famin that he ſpake óf before: which now he telleth them, is very great: and ſheweth how it cometh upon them.

In what maner it cometh upon them, is heere ſet down, firſt by declaring the power &amp; ſtrength of it: then what effect enſueth thereon. The power &amp; ſtrength of it is ſuch, that theſe weake vermins (being ſo ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by God as they are, to this purpoſe) are compared to a

For although it came not in ſo ſtrange maner, as the other, nor as ſome others that heretofore this land
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:173383:30"/>hath ſeene; yet may wee finde it to bee ſuch, as ſheweth it ſelfe to have come óf God: proceeding, as it did, of ſo unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable weather, and eſpecially the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon being ſo very wet, both in ſeed time and harueſt, two yeeres together. And although it did not ſtrengthen ús, ſo much as the other did them: yet muſt it needes touch us neere alſo, when as not only our corne failed ſo much as it did, but our cattle alſo, great, and ſmale: and that in a maner, generally through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole, and in all parts of the Land whatſoever.
<note place="margin">The like ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ple among us alſo are to be quick ned up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of it.</note> The ſame ſort of people likewiſe, whom the Prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led on thén, might well be called on at this preſent: thoſe that have lived in ſome ſpeciall exceſſe; and others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that have lived in pleaſure, in that aboundance that God hath given them. For if they have lived in ſome ſpecial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe, then have they good cauſe to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, not only on behalfe of them ſelves that now were ſtrengthned ſo much the more; and, for that they did ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouſly offend thereby: but alſo, becauſe that exceſſe of theirs was ſo great a cauſe of that ſcarcity ſince. So likewiſe, if they
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:173383:30"/>did no more, but only enjoy their owne aboundance, yet therein alſo they have good cauſe to lament: partly for that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them at the leaſt were ſince much ſtreightned of that liberall allowaunce, that before they tooke to them ſelves; but eſpecially, for that hereby they may finde, that ſeeing they would neuer take up of them ſelves, but ſtill take their pleaſure ſo much as they did, they have ſo brought to paſſe, that, to their further reproach ſince, God himſelfe was fain, in this ſort to teach them, to gather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves unto ſome better courſe of ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. That both theſe ſorts alſo are to take one, and the ſelſe ſame leſſon (together with thoſe others) out of the Prophet, it needeth ſo much the leſſe to be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as we may very plainly ſee, that all ſuch diſpoſition of theirs is ever void of all ſuch affections, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding much doth neede them. For firſt as touching thoſe that give them ſelves to ſo great exceſſe, as they doe never ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint them ſelves with any kinde of godly ſorrow; ſo, by the reaſon of the exceſſe that they doe uſe, they are not ſo much as able, in any good meaſure,
<pb facs="tcp:173383:31"/>to hold up their eyes or to awake: and yet were it good, and needfull for them, not only to ſtir up themſelves, and to awake, that ſo they might the better ſee what caſe they are in, before it be too late to amend it; but alſo to give them ſelves to earneſt ſorrow, both in reſpect of the waſte they haue made, and for the vengeance that is due to the ſame. Then alſo as touching thoſe that have not made ſo great exceſſe; but, bicauſe they had wherewithall, have alwaies framed their portion accordingly, and taken their pleaſure of the aboundance that God hath given them, becauſe that uſe of aboundance and wealth doth ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily make men to forget them ſelves, and unable to beare in good and orderly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, a ſtraighter allowance: therefore are théy alſo ſo much the rather to ſtir up them ſelves from that their drowſie forgetfulneſſe; and to be ſorie, that they have ſo far diſabled them ſelves, to take in good part, &amp; quietly to beare an harder eſtate.
<note place="margin">Our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row alſo ought to be ſound.</note> And bicauſe that ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny waies, we have ſo far provoked the wrath of God againſt us, and eſpecially both theſe ſorts aforeſaid, therefore it is
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:173383:31"/>meete likewiſe, that we never content ourſelves with a ſlender ſorrowing, but that ever wee ſeeke to bring it to the meaſure that of them is required, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have heard: eſpecially, when the reaſons that the Prophet there doth uſe, doe come (in a maner) as neere unto us, as they did to them. For firſt as touching the thing it ſelf, although the good bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of the earth were not altogether ſo much cut óf from us (eſpecially from thoſe that now we ſpeak óf, bicauſe that they wil lightly have them, when others do need them) as they were from thém: yet were they ſo far cut óf from ús alſo, that very many were much diſtreſſed, &amp; ſome among us utterly loſt; and thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that among ús had before ſo excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, or els had but lived in that aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, could ſince in no wiſe holde on that courſe, nor come any thing neere it, but that needs they muſt ſtreighten the meaner ſort ſo farre, that they ſhould make them ſelves anſwerable for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe of thoſe that were ſtreightned, or did miſcarie. Which our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was in ſuch ſorte alſo ſent unto us
<pb facs="tcp:173383:32"/>from the hand of God, as that it coulde not have bene avoided of us, but was unto us as a mighty people, ouer-ſtrong for us to deale withall: and hath in a maner laide much of our land waſte likewiſe, not only for that our cattle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and our corn failed, ſo much as they did; but alſo, for that by reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, even yet alſo many of our paſtures are empty, and no ſmale part of our land for a time unſowen for want of ſeede.
<note place="margin">The like reaſons with ús, as with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> Then as touching thoſe others that in ſuch ſort were touched there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, as that the ſame ought to be a reaſon to ús, rather to ſorrow for that hand of God upon us, we may eaſily ſee, that the ſame kinde of people alſo with us, were in like ſort touched as were thoſe others. For firſt to come to the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> it is moſt evident, that the ſervice of the Lord not only was, but yet alſo is ſo very much failed, in many of our churches likewiſe, that our miniſtery or eccleſiaſticall eſtate hath good cauſe to moorn: all the whole multitude of us for the want of Gods ſervice in ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as were to be wiſhed; &amp; many of us
<pb facs="tcp:173383:32"/>alſo, for want of things needefull to this praeſent life, which not-withſtanding cometh not ſo much of the ſcarcitie that now we ſpeak óf, (for then it might be more eaſily born, and were likely to be much ſooner amended) as it doth out of two other cauſes that are much ſtronger, and make the ſore almoſt incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. Whereof the one is that ſort of Impropriations, that hath altogether taken away many of our church-livings, not only from the miniſterie, but alſo from al other eccleſiaſtical uſe: the other, that inſatiable greedines of moſt of our Patrons, that daily more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to their own proper uſe, either the whole, or els ſome part of thoſe that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, &amp; were co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mitted, of ſpecial truſt, unto their defence &amp; cuſtody. Our <hi>buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen</hi> likwiſe were ſo much diſtreſſed, that they had not wherewithall to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve their moſt juſt &amp; urgent neceſſities; and their woonted joy (in thoſe matters alſo) was parted from them: and yet, not only by the late ſcarcity that then they were in; but by the hard dealing of their hard and unmercifull Land-lords, that now of long (ſince the daies of our peace,

<note n="ſ" place="margin">1:14.</note> they are willed in the name of them all, to <hi>crie unto the Lord.</hi> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the Prophets further urging them hereunto,
<note place="margin">Strongly urging the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> unto it.</note> I am to acknowledge herewithal, that the ſame which I do take in that ſenſe, ſome others do take rather as the form of co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plaint, that they were to make unto the Lord: which alſo is a good ſenſe, and may well agree with the text it ſelfe. But in my judgment it lieth more likely, to be the ſpeach of the Prophet himſelfe; then to be appointed to them, for the form of their complaint: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore haue I ſo applied it here, not praeju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicing the judgment of any other. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in firſt the Prophet laboreth thoſe <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Miniſters of the Lord</hi> to take that courſe that he hath called them unto: then, though they will not, yet he profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he for his part will ſurely do it. In this his labouring of others, we are to note, firſt, that by likelyhood he eſpied them to be over heavie in this matter: then, in what maner thereupon he doth
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:173383:34"/>labour them. If they were ſo heavie hereunto, that the Prophet needed ſo to labour them, then did the Prophet very well, ſo much the more to put to the ſpur, as he did ſee that the heavines of thoſe did neede it. In the maner of his labouring of them we are to note, firſt, that the Prophet him ſelfe doth la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that their diſtreſſe: then how he ſheweth verie good reaſon, that ſo he may. He lamenteth it
<note n="t" place="margin">1:15.</note> in crying out, <hi>Alas for this day.</hi> Then coming to ſhew, that he doth it not lightly, but hath good reaſon ſo to do, firſt he ſetteth down the reaſon it ſelfe: and then he doth confirm the ſame.<note place="margin">By very good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> The reaſon it ſelfe that here he giveth, is no more in effect, but to ſhew how ſorrowfull a day it is: and that doth he two waies; firſt, as touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it; and then, by the maner of proceeding. For the ſubſtance of it, he ſaith, that
<note n="v" place="margin">1:15.</note> it is a <hi>day of deſtruction,</hi> or that doth make them <hi>vtterly waſte.</hi> In the maner of proceeding, or in what ſort it cometh upon the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he noteth two things: one, that it cometh mightily on them, or in very ſtrong maner, calling it the day <hi>of the Lord,</hi> and ſaying that it cometh
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:173383:35"/>
               <hi>from the almightie;</hi> the other, that it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at <hi>hand,</hi> or that now they are very neere to utter deſtruction. In his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it, firſt he ſetteth down the matter, out of which he will confirm it: &amp; then confirmeth or further ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth that ſame likewiſe. The
<note n="x" place="margin">1:16.</note> matter that he ſetteth down for the confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, reſteth in two pointes: the one, that their <hi>meate is cut óf before their eyes;</hi> or that they may plainly and evidently ſee, that now they have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whereon to live: the other, that <hi>ioy and gladnes is alſo cut óf from the houſe of their God,</hi> as evident a token of pręſent deſtruction, as the other is. That which he bringeth for the confirmation and further ſtrengthning of this alſo, is by ſhewing that thoſe things are utterly failed, which ſhould miniſter, both to them all neceſſarie foode: and joy and gladneſſe to thoſe that ſerved in the houſe of the Lord. To this end he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth, firſt as touching their
<note n="y" place="margin">1:17.</note> corn, that they had ſo litle hope or comfort there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (partly for ſo much as was ſown, was moſt of it <hi>rotten under the clods,</hi> by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:173383:35"/>wet; and partly for that ſuch as was left, was alſo <hi>withered</hi>) that now men did co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>monly let even their <hi>barnes, and garners goe down:</hi> then, as touching their
<note n="z" place="margin">1:18.</note> cattle, not onely that they all moorn, but alſo that both their heards of greater <hi>cattle pine away for lack of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture</hi> (that was deſtroyed by immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<note n="a" place="margin">1:19, 20.</note> heat that afterward followed) but alſo that even their <hi>flocks of ſheepe,</hi> who are woont to make good ſhift, in very bare paſtures, were loſt notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, even the whole <hi>flocks</hi> for lack of paſture. In his profeſſion or proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hé will doe it, although they will not, we are to note, firſt, what it is that he will doe, and then, wherefore he will doe the ſame. That which he will doe, is, that he will
<note n="b" place="margin">1:19.</note> 
               <hi>crie unto the Lord.</hi> The reaſon is, for that the fier <hi>hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the lodges or paſtures of the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and flamb hath burnt up the trees of the fiedes:</hi> and for the beaſts <hi>of the fielde did alſo</hi> (after their maner) <hi>crie unto him,</hi> for want of water, bicauſe the rivers were <hi>dried up;</hi> and for want of <hi>meat,</hi> bicauſe their paſtures were devoured or burnt with heat.</p>

And whereas thoſe ordinarie teachers, which no doubt were many, were now ſo earneſtly called upon by this our Prophet, who was ſent in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarily, and was but one: it alſo may teach us, that though our ordinarie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, bee many, yet may they forget them ſelues ſo much (euen all, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times) that God may finde it needefull, to ſend in ſome other extraordinarilie, to put them in minde of ſuch matters, and to quicken them up thereunto; and though théy be many, and the other but one, yet may they not therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe him.

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:173383:36"/>advancement of his glorie: and though they be the <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or ſervants <hi>of God:</hi> yet are they not alwaies ſo carefull of the ſervice of him, whoſe ſervants they are. And as at this time one other was found, that had no part of his living of the <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar,</hi> nor was any of the number of thoſe, that were the ordinarie <hi>ſervants</hi> of God; and yet was very carefull for the <hi>Altar,</hi> and to promote his maiſters buſines: ſo in theſe daies alſo it pleaſeth God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſtir up ſome one or other amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g us, that being nothing maintained by the altar, nor any of our ordinarie tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers neither, nevertheleſſe doth that kind of buſines much more ſometimes then thoſe that are; and when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth God to ſend any ſuch, they are not lightly to be regarded. In that they are admoniſhed, firſt to ſtir up them ſelves to ſorrow, before that they ſhould call u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon others, that ſo they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter doe it; therein likewiſe may we ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well note, what cauſe it is that they have to follow, that in this caſe would do any good: that is, firſt of all to begin with them ſelves, from whom others are to take their light and direction.

In that they were willed to publiſh a faſt, to gather the people unto it, and when they were com together, then to pour forth their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints unto God, out of it may we learn to doe the like: that is, that though our ſelves cannot appoint it, but muſt await the appointme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoſe that are in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign authoritie (ſo far as we looke that others ſhould be tied unto it) yet both that we doe admoniſh others, both the

               <hi>they run vp and down</hi> therein a long by the <hi>wales,</hi> &amp; into the <hi>houſes,</hi> to deſtroy and to ſpoil. As it is ſet foorth unto us, out of the effect that it worketh: the Pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>phet doth not only note what effect it is that it worketh: but alſo the reaſon, why it cometh to paſſe that it hath ſo ſtrong an effect. The effect that it worketh, is, that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhalbe at their wits end
<note n="t" place="margin">2:10.</note> as if the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; the earth were aſtoniſhed at it, &amp; clean confounded and as if the <hi>Sun</hi> &amp; the <hi>Moone</hi> were darkened, &amp; the <hi>Stars</hi> tooke in their light a gain. In giuing of the reaſon here of the Prophet doth not onely ſhewe what the reaſon is: but alſo how mightily the ſame doth worke.
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:173383:44"/>The reaſon it ſelfe that cauſed this effect to enſue, is that
<note n="v" place="margin">2:11.</note> the Lorde himſelfe did by his word authorize, and by his power enable hereunto: and it is ſaid to worke ſo mightily, that the ſame day ſhould be <hi>great and verie terrible,</hi> and that none ſhuld be <hi>able to abide it.</hi>
               <note place="margin">An exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to publike faſt.</note> In the exhortation that now doth next enſue whereby he laboureth to bring them to a publike hartie repentance, we are to conſider, firſt how to that end he doth ſet before them the worde of the Lord: then, howe himſelfe doth further deale with them thereupon. In the word of the Lord that he ſetteth before them
<note n="x" place="margin">2:12.</note> he doth not onely ſhew what it is that the Lord would have them to do, that is, <hi>to turn unto him with all the heart, and with faſting and weeping, and with moorning:</hi> but alſo, that <hi>even yet,</hi> he would have the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to take that courſe, though they have driven óf verie long alreadie. That ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dealing that hereupon the Prophet himſelfe uſeth towards them, reſteth in two points: firſt that he doth in like ſort cal them unto the ſelfe ſame courſe, then that he uſeth ſome ſtrength of reaſon to perſwade them unto it. He doth in like
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:173383:45"/>ſort call them to the ſame courſe, by wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them
<note n="y" place="margin">2:11.</note> to <hi>rent their hearts, and not their garments,</hi> and <hi>to turne vnto the Lord their God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſtrength of reaſon that there hee uſeth to perſwade them herein, is upon the likely-hoode they have to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine favour: which he doth, firſt by ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe very plainely, how mercifull the Lord is: then by inſinuating how themſelues may become partakers of it. As touching the mercifulnes of God
<note n="z" place="margin">2:13.</note> he plainely ſaith, that <hi>he is gracious</hi> and <hi>mercifull, Slow to anger, of great kindnes,</hi> and one that will readily turne from the euill that he purpoſed. How themſelues may be partakers of it, though he do not plainely tell them: yet both he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate the ſame; and putteth them in good hope of a ſpeciall bleſſing. That which he doth inſinuate to them, is that they ſeeke it in moſt carneſt maner, as a thing that otherwiſe is hard to be attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: and thereupon demandeth
<note n="a" place="margin">2:14.</note> 
               <hi>who doth know,</hi> whether he will not be intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to leaue a bleſſing behinde him? The ſpeciall bleſſing that he putteth them in hope to obtein, is that after that great
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:173383:45"/>famine, it might be, that the Lord would yet give ſuch great plenty, that they ſhould content themſelves to part with, a

            <p>In his latter repetition wherein he ſeemeth to have it is purpoſe now, but onely to knit up the matter briefly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving already called on them ſufficiently for it, firſt the Prophet doth will them to bid or publiſh this faſt: then doth he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them in a fewe principall things that doe concerne the maner of it. In that he doth will them to publiſh this faſt, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth withal, both that he would have the exerciſe held: &amp; that he would haue the congregation gathered together to ſolemnize the ſame.

<note n="l" place="margin">2. <hi>Kings</hi> 14:21.</note> is called Aziriah) we are to ſee in what ſort he is deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us: firſt as touching his inclination to Religion; and then as touching his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in ſuch thinges as belonged to his ciuil eſtate. In his inclination to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion likewiſe we are to conſider what was commendable in him: and what was reprovable. Commendable it is, that he is
<note n="m" place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26:4, 5.</note> ſaid to have done <hi>uprightly in the ſight of the Lord,</hi> and that in the dayes of Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariah, who underſtoode the viſions of God, he did more ſpecially <hi>ſeek the Lord;</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:173383:52"/>and in ſuch ſort ſomtimes, that the Lord did proſper him for it. It is likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provable
<note n="n" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid. verſ.</hi> 4.</note> that he folowed not the Lord with all his heart, but onely as his <hi>father Amaziah</hi> did (of whom it is ſaid
<note n="o" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ibid.</hi> 25:5.</note> that he did uprightly in the ſight of the Lorde but not <hi>with a perfect heart;</hi> as alſo
<note n="p" place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 14:4.</note> that he tooke not away the <hi>high places,</hi> but that the people did <hi>ſacrifice</hi> and <hi>burne incenſe thereon:</hi> and that

As touching his diſpoſition in theſe matters that concerne his ciuill eſtate, ſome there were that were honorable unto him; others againe, that did not ſo well become the perſon and ſtate that he ſuſteined. Honorable it was, that he
<note n="r" place="margin">2. <hi>Chro.</hi> 26:6, 7, 8.</note> did ſo valiantly againſt the enemies, the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines, Arabians, and Ammonites: and that

<pb n="72" facs="tcp:173383:52"/>for them all maner of <hi>furniture,</hi> even to the very ſtones that were for their ſlings. That which did not ſo well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the perſon and ſtate that he ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was that he had ſuch a fanſie to huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry &amp; <hi>imployed himſelfe ſo</hi> very much about his owne priuate gaine. For
<note n="t" place="margin">

            <p>But as touching
<note n="x" place="margin">2. <hi>King.</hi> 15:34, 35 <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>Chho.</hi> 27:2, 3, 6.</note> his inclination to Religion, wee are more ſpecially to note, that though it bee ſaide of him, that hee did uprightly in the ſight of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:173383:53"/>the Lord; and builded the high gate in the houſe of the Lord: yet is it witneſſed alſo, that he ſought the Lord, but <hi>as his father did;</hi> that the <hi>high places</hi> remained, and the <hi>people corrupted</hi> their wayes; and that himſelfe did not <hi>enter into the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Out of certaine of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</note> The Prophets that doe apperteine, both to this people that we haue in ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and to the time that now wee ſpeake of, are onely Iſaiah, Amos, and Micah: of which, Iſaiah onely kept himſelfe to the Iewes alone (I meane in the firſt part of his prophecie, which is all, as I noted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we may ſeeke to for this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) whereas both the others ſpake to the Iſaralites, and Iewes together. But they all eaſily may be found in a people that have ſuch Princes as we ſee that Vzziah and Iotham were.
<note place="margin">Iſaiah.</note> For Iſaiah firſt rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them, not onely in matters that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne Religion: but alſo for ſuch other vices, as may very well ſeeme to come from ſuch diſpoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as their Princes had. Concerning Religion, he plainely char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them that
<note n="y" place="margin">5:24.</note> they had caſt of the law of the Lord, and contemned the word of the holy one of Iſrael: and that they
<note n="z" place="margin">1:19.</note> had <hi>groves</hi> and <hi>high places,</hi> and deligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:173383:53"/>therein: and therefore
<note n="a" place="margin">1:11-15.</note> did the Lord earneſtly proteſt, that he miſliked al their offrings &amp; holy aſſemblies. As touching other vices among them, ſome he layeth to the charge of all generally: others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine more ſpecially to the charge of ſome. Generally to all, that wheras now, they ſhould haue
<note n="b" place="margin">5.4.</note> brought foorth the right or <hi>naturall grape,</hi> they
<note n="c" place="margin">5:19.</note> made light of the <hi>threatning</hi> of God; and
<note n="d" place="margin">3:9.</note> were of ſuch countenances, that, that thereby they made their ſin manifeſt even as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. More ſpecially hee noteth the greater ſort of them with two ſpeciall faults: both with hard dealing towardes others; and, when ſo they are come to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate wealth, that then they wax in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent and exceſſiue therewith. As tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching their hard dealing, ſome part of it he ſeemeth to allot to thoſe that deale in adminiſtration of juſtice: and ſome part of it to others againe indifferently. Thoſe that deale in adminiſtration of juſtice he charged that
<note n="e" place="margin">1:23.</note> they loved gifts and <hi>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rewardes:</hi> and that
<note n="f" place="margin">5:7.</note> in <hi>ſteede of Iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: there was oppreſſion, and in ſteede of righteouſnes, crying:</hi> That which he laid to the charge of others of them indifferent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:173383:54"/>was, that they
<note n="g" place="margin">5:8.</note> joyned <hi>houſe to houſe</hi> and <hi>land to land,</hi> that they might dwell alone that their
<note n="i" place="margin">1:15.</note> handes were full of blood; that they
<note n="k" place="margin">3:14, 15.</note> did <hi>eate up</hi> the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeard: having the <hi>ſpoyle of the poore</hi> in their houſes, beating the people in <hi>pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> &amp; <hi>grinding</hi> the very <hi>faces</hi> of the pore. As touching their owne inſolencie, and exceſſe he chargeth them alſo, that they
<note n="l" place="margin">2:11.27.</note> had high lookes, and were hauty and <hi>loftie:</hi> &amp; that not only all that ſort of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> generally

<note n="n" place="margin">3:16-24.</note> the women were <hi>proude, nice,</hi> &amp; <hi>vaine</hi> in their behaviour, &amp; exceſſive and coſtly in their attire.
<note place="margin">Amos.</note> Amos dealeth not very much with the Iewes (to ſpeake of) yet he alſo chargeth them both with great default towards religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; with thoſe other vices beſides.

<note n="p" place="margin">6:3.</note> he alſo do charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that they <hi>deale violently</hi> with
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:173383:54"/>others, or approch to the ſeat of iniquity: &amp; that they

               <note place="margin">Micah.</note> Micah likewiſe doth charge them partly with co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tumacie to wards God: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially with hard dealing towardes their neighbour. As for the former he plainely ſaith, that
<note n="t" place="margin">2:6.</note> they forbad the true Prophets to prophecy unto them, &amp; choſe rather to hear men pleaſers. As touching their hard dealing towardes others, firſt hee layeth that ſin to their charge: then he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth certain judgements of God againſt them.

            <p n="14">14 Hauing ſo found out what thoſe ſinnes were,
<note place="margin">What thoſe ſins of theirs were.</note> that ſtorie of that praeſent time doth lay to their charge, nowe may we with one labour beholde, both what thoſe ſins were, with which the people were infected then, and which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet would have them to leave, and turn to the Lord: and what thoſe ſinnes were, which wé alſo may thinke of on behalfe of our ſelves, if ſo it be, that by this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion we thinke good now, in ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all maner to turne to the Lord. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them, in Religion firſt we ſee, that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:173383:55"/>their Princes them ſelves were farre to ſeeke of that ſinceritie and zeal,
<note place="margin">In Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: vvhich vvas pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by them, but much neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected.</note> that was to bee looked for of them. For though they did not give themſelues to Idolatry as diuers others of their anceſtors had done, nor yet inhibit the ſervice of God by the law appointed: yet were they but weak profeſſors of Religion them ſelves, and tolerated much corruption beſides among their people. Vzziah, though he ſought the Lord, and did uprightly, in compariſon of many others: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding had not his heart perfect, and plainely declared himſelfe to be very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, or at leaſt very careles of a known, and a principall point of the law of God. He was ſuch an <hi>husband,</hi> that it is leſſe maruel though he were but a meane <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.</hi> Iotham his ſonne built a faire gate unto the Temple, but himſelfe did not enter into it. Though he laid open a way unto others and that in faire, and honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble maner: yet himſelfe did take no bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of it. It was well, that hee made a way to others: but it had beene much better, if he had take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the uſe thereof to him ſelfe likewiſe. And as for the people, it is plainely ſet downe, that in the dayes of
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:173383:56"/>both theſe, they had the <hi>high places,</hi> and worſhipped there: which was clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the rule that the Lawe prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. But ſeeing that we have ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent teſtimonie of the ignorance of the one, and coldenes of the other, it is no great marvell, if neither of them both did much regard it: the one, becauſe it may well be that the lawe of God, or at leaſt that it was not of ſo great importance; the other, for that himſelfe caring ſo litle as he did to frequent the Temple, he coulde leſſe miſlike of others that came there as litle as hee, but elſe-where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed the devotion they had. It may be alſo that firſt hee himſelfe, and then the people together with him, refuſed the Temple and worſhipped elſe-where, becauſe that Vzziah his father was in ſuch ſort ſtroken there for going to farre. For ſuch is the untowardnes (or fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardnes rather) of the heart of man, that if they may not doe as they would, neither will they in any wiſe be brought to doe as they ſhould.
<note place="margin">In civile matters they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided well againſt the enemy but were grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to their own people at home.</note> In matters that concerne their civile eſtate, firſt that they both were ſo well given (but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the father) to fortifie Ieruſalem,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:173383:56"/>and before hand to provide, and to have in a readines ſuch forces and furniture, as were meete for the needefull defence of the State, it was not onely very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable and honorable to themſelves: but alſo to great uſe to the Church of God. For Ieruſalem had then enemies inow, and the people of God had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe been in danger of them. And yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that otherwiſe Religion was no better regarded, thereby it appeareth, that this tended not ſo much to the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruation of the Church of God: as, either to their owne honour, or to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of their earthly eſtate.
<note place="margin">Inordinate care of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uat wealth not meete for the higher ſort.</note> But that they were ſo very much given (eſpecially the father) to encreaſe their priuate wealth, that was not onely evill in it ſelfe: but, no doubt, the occaſion of much evill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides. It was ill in it ſelfe, firſt becauſe the lawe of God
<note n="g" place="margin">
                  <hi>Deut.</hi> 17:17.</note> did plainely ſette downe, that ſuch as ſhoulde bee Kings ouer his people, ſhoulde not multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie their treaſure, or endevour them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to encreaſe their riches; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that

                  <hi>Num.</hi> 26:52 56. <hi>Ioſ.</hi> 11:25.</note> praeſcribed unto them ſuch a diſtribution of the land among them, as woulde not affoorde the Prince to
<pb facs="tcp:173383:57"/>have any ſuch part to his owne proper uſe: then alſo, becauſe that it was not ſeemely, but very diſhonorable, that ſuch as ſhoulde make others rich, and attend the wealth of all, ſhould ſo much bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto the loue of money themſelves, as ſuch kinde of exerciſe doth import that they were. For otherwiſe, to what ende ſhoulde the King of Iudah have ſo much <hi>cattle,</hi> in the <hi>valleyes,</hi> and in the <hi>plaine;</hi> yea even in the <hi>wast</hi> or <hi>deſert pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces?</hi> To what other ende ſhould he digge thoſe <hi>wels</hi> and ſet up thoſe new <hi>buildings</hi> of his for his heardes and flocks, and for ſuch as he had to attend upon them? To what other ende ſhoulde hee have ſuch <hi>fields</hi> and <hi>vineyards, plough-men</hi> likewiſe, and <hi>dreſſers of vines.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Much euil cometh thereby.</note> The evill that by oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion hereof might otherwiſe come, may be ſo much, and ſo very great, that hardly may any man think to find out or to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon the ſame: inſomuch that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle himſelfe doth account it the roote of all ill. But if we may find that ſuch things as the Prophets (as before was alleaged) did lay to the charge of that people, and of that time may juſtly bee imputed to this: then ſhall that courſe bee ſufficient
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:173383:57"/>for us; and we ſhall not neede to force any more upon it. For if the defect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that thoſe Prophets doe charge them withall, and thoſe other vices, may be found to be of that nature, that they might proceed of this, then is it no wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g ſo to conceave of ſuch inclination of theirs, and the matter that now we have in hand will be ſufficiently cleared like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.
<note place="margin">Coldnes in religion.</note> Firſt therefore as touching that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of theirs in religion, without al quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion ít might eaſily come of thís. For whereſoever there is ſuch a love of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate wealth, &amp; a nature diſpoſed, ſo buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to imploy it ſelfe, about thoſe inferior &amp; earthly matters, there is religion ſoone let downe, or thriueth but ill, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ſort as yet it ſtand.
<note place="margin">Hard dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with others.</note> But then if we come to thoſe other vices (hard dealing with others, and exceſſe in them ſelves) thoſe are of ſuch nature, as that euery one may plainely ſee, how they may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kindely proceede of ſuch diſpoſition of thoſe as before is deſcribed. For as for their hard dealing with others, when the Princes themſelves get into their handes thoſe <hi>fields</hi> and <hi>vineyeards,</hi> and had ſuch <hi>paſtures,</hi> and were ſuch <hi>husbands</hi> for <hi>corne,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:173383:58"/>cattle,</hi> and <hi>wines,</hi> what others were there in all that country (that had ability) that would not ſoone attempt the like: when as the Princes example had firſt ſet them on, and gave them beſides ſo good hope of protection for the time to come? And ſurely it is not unlikely, but that al gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (eſpecially the greater ſort of them) did ſo follow on this naughty courſe ſo ill begun, that it is no marvel, though Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iah complaine ſo earneſtly both of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>houſe to houſe, &amp; land to land,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that, that when ſuch things come in quaeſtion, and the weaker ſort were faine to ſeeke to the Magiſtrate for helpe, their <hi>oppreſſion</hi> notwithſtanding was litle ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſtill they had juſt cauſe to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaine.</hi> Mo marvel neither, though Micah do ſo grievouſly charge them, to be <hi>full of crueltie; to lie in wait for blood, to hunt</hi> their neighbors; to take away from them their <hi>grounds,</hi> &amp; <hi>houſes;</hi> to oppreſſe a man, and his <hi>heritagé;</hi> to ſpoil the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of their <hi>garments,</hi> in time of <hi>peacé;</hi> to ſpare neither <hi>ſexe</hi> nor <hi>age;</hi> to pull of their <hi>skins;</hi> &amp; to <hi>chop</hi> them in <hi>peeces</hi> unto the <hi>pot:</hi> and that the <hi>beſt</hi> of them all are ſo infected with his corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that although they deal much more

            <p n="15">15 But to leave them, and to come to our ſelves, firſt as touching Religion,

For whereas religion was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted before, and both ſuperſtition and idolatrie alſo were commonly taken for the true worſhip of God, they have laide the word of God before them, and made reformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> according to the level there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: and beſides this generall reformation for all, ſomtimes beſides they have more ſpecially ſought the Lorde, when ſome ſpeciall cauſe hath ſo required; and when they have had concurring withal the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of ſuch, as have dealt ſincerely with them in the name of the Lord. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it is very cleare, that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:173383:59"/>againe that high, and chiefe, and principall <hi>gate</hi> of the Temple, even Ieſus Chriſt (who ſaid himſelfe, that he was the <hi>gate or dore</hi> to the houſe of the Lord) and have not onely made a ready way for all to enter into the houſe of the Lorde; but alſo have beene at ſpeciall charges in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing the rúines of the buildings them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that are to that uſe.
<note place="margin">But the like cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption to be founde likewiſe.</note> But then it is to be doubted withall, that the infirmitie &amp; corruption that was in them, doth cleave ouer faſt to us likewiſe: &amp; ſo conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is not done <hi>with a perfect heart;</hi> but rather as ſome Amaziah hath done, that is gone before us.

For if theſe had bin of that other ſort of <hi>high places,</hi> that is, of thoſe that were ordeined to the uſe of idolatry, then could not theſe Kinges that let them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, in any ſenſe have had that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, that they <hi>did uprightly in the ſight of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> Taking it therefore in the other ſenſe, their overſight or fault was this, that they did not make the people to come to Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (as the Lord had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed) to worſhip there: but ſuffred the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to worſhip in divers other places, that they had before inured themſelves unto. In which ſenſe it doth challenge us alſo herein to be offendors with them: that is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:173383:60"/>that wee alſo have <hi>high places</hi> remaining, whereſoever God is not worſhiped as he hath appointed, but onely after our owne cuſtome.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:173383:61"/>And diligent ſearchers (I am perſwaded) might likewiſe find that whether it were the fault of Iotham or not, that he would not enter into the Temple, becauſe his father might not thére doe what hee would; yet that it might plainly be found in diuers of ús, that there is no greater cauſe of the abſence of many of us: and that as Iotham that entered not into the Temple, neuertheleſſe beſtowed coſt on it; ſo it might be founde among us, that divers of thoſe that in outwarde ſhewe beare a good countenance towardes the Goſpell, and doe ſomewhat for it, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe when neede requireth are but diſſembling and looſe friends unto it.

In ſo much that exceſſe is much greater with ús, then it was with them: and as for oppreſſion, both it is very rife among us (even the moſt

<note place="margin">The nature of this ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of God conſidered may indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent plainely teach us our offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces herein.</note> And ſeeing that theſe thinges are ſo rife among us, we are leſſe to maruel, and withall to acknowledge his righteous judgements, that God hath ſo touched us with this late ſcarcity: both for the abuſe of his plenty before, and for our hard dealing with our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours alſo.

            <p n="16">16 Now to returne to our Prophet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine,

And if wé likewiſe may aſſure our ſelves of the like mercies, when ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we ſhall turne unto him, although I know that our hearts bee very heavie to ſuch a purpoſe: yet dare I before hand ſet downe this for moſt certaine, both that the benefites them ſelves which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed here, are of ſuch importance, and that we are (in theſe dayes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell) in ſo likely a way to obteine them, that even this conſideration onely ought to be of that account with us, as that we ſhould neede nothing elſe to moove us to ſuch a publike repentance, as in this place the Prophet doth call them unto.

            </p>
            <p>The reaſons he addeth to tende to this ende, to ſhewe howe notably he meaneth to refreſh them: firſt ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hee will give them victuals a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine; then alſo declaring, in how plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull manner he will doe it. The bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to confirme them in the former, firſt he aſſureth them of ſeaſonable weather: then hee telleth them howe fruitfull thoſe yeares ſhall bee thereby. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the weather, he ſaith, that he will give unto them
<note n="c" place="margin">2:23.</note> raine and ſhowers juſt in their ſeaſon, and ſo ſoone as ever neede requireth. Concerning the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he ſheweth that thoſe yeres ſhould be ſo fruitfull,
<note n="d" place="margin">2:24.</note> that their <hi>barnes</hi> ſhoulde be full of wheate; and their <hi>preſſes</hi> runne

In that which tendeth to ſhew how this his mercie is extended foorth to the time to come, we are to conſider, firſt what it is that hee ſaith of that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: then how he repeateth ſome part of it againe. That which he ſaith of that matter, is
<note n="g" place="margin">2:26.</note> firſt that his <hi>people ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be aſhamed:</hi> then, on the other ſide, that

               <hi>his people</hi> ſhall never after be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded</hi> again.</p>
            <p n="17">17 Herein alſo to remember our ſelves,
<note place="margin">The like affection of God to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ús.</note> firſt as touching that affection of God towards them, it was in deede very
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:173383:67"/>great, that he could put on the whole po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of <hi>Ielouſié</hi> on their behalfe, and that in ſuch ſort as it doth apperteine unto his nature, that is, very fully, or in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree that can be. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, if we conſider the great and ſingular bleſſinges that he hath alreadie in theſe daies of the Goſpel beſtowed upon us, &amp; how many wais he hath already oft times declared his favour towards us, both at home among ourſelves, and a broade a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt our enemies by ſea, and by land; in peace, and in warre; in Religion, and matters of State; and how ſo ever elſe: it ought (no doubt) to be ſo farre óf, for any man to thinke it over bolde a part, for us to account of the like favour of his to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardes ús alſo, (if we truely turne unto him) that rather we offende if wee doe it not, and doe over much call into quaeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his goodnes towardes us, when hee hath already ſo many waies ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared the ſame. And if he be ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined towards us; we neede not doubt, but that in theſe, and al things els, he wil be readie to deale with us accordingly. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as touching the remooving of thoſe evils, that of late were, or yet are hanging
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:173383:67"/>upon us, as he did aſſure thém,
<note place="margin">How like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is that God will now deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ús alſo, from this hand of his upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us.</note> that ſo far as it concerned the releef of their bodies, he would not only eaſe them of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame famine, but alſo bleſſe them with great plenty: ſo likewiſe we may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ceave, that he may be induced in ſuch ſort to deale with us alſo upon our repentance, not only becauſe that he ever is very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to all that turne unto him; but alſo becauſe he hath already eaſed us of a good part of our ſcarcity, &amp; for this yere that now cometh in, he hath hitherto gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven (his name be ever bleſſed therefore) as great tokens of ſpeciall plenty, as at any time heretofore for theſe many yeres we have lightly had. In like maner, whereas he promiſed, to deliver thém of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, for thát matter he is before-hand with us; partly for that he hath holpen us ſo far alredy, and our ſcarcity when it was at the worſt, yet was it not ſo extreme (by any want that God hath ſent us, but only by the hardnes of greedy men) as that any way it might turn us, or our profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on unto reproach; and partly for that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of our neighbours that are about us, and ſubject unto Popery yet (from whom our reproach doth ever ariſe, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

And as, to the end that he might better lift up the harts of that people to the aſſura<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of theſe his promiſes, he turneth his talk unto the earth, &amp; to the creatures that are therin, willing them no more to fear, but to rejoice in reſpect of that plenty that now was towards them: ſo may we ſee, that already he hath in ſuch ſort ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto the earth on our behalf, that wel it may rejoice our hearts now to behold it; &amp; therby alſo doth ſo comfort &amp; cheere thoſe creatures that ar therin, that they alſo muſt needs be joiful to ſee the earth in that likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, to be ſo well repleniſhed with alſuch things as they do need. But where as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them, that he would make ſo clean a riddance of thoſe noyſome creatures that they ſhould be ſcattred into all quarters far from them, &amp; that their ſtinch ſhould ariſe up unto heaven; although we cannot ſee the ſame in this caſe of ours, be cauſe our ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did not come by ſuch noyſome creatures, but onely by that immoderate moyſture in ſeede time &amp; harveſt: yet may we ſee, that in effect he hath done it in eaſing us therof ſo much as we ſee alredy he hath done, and the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:173383:68"/>performance thereof we may hope, both in this, &amp; in the reſidue of thoſe evils that now are on us, or otherwiſe may ſeeme to hang o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our heads, &amp; to be in a redines to fall upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us. Then if we come to the people the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves to whom he doth ſo comfortably ſpeake, we alſo muſt note, that where as they are none others but the children of Zion; neither may wé look to find that favour with him, unles we ſort our ſelves to that co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany. The mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God towards his are great: but ever (lightly) reſtrained withall to thoſe that are his. Though the tree be never ſo full of ſap: yet no part of it is lightly imparted, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto ſuch boughs &amp; branches as belong therunto. As for the reſidue, wherein he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth to relieve their neceſſity, &amp; to doe it in ſo plentifull maner, we may very wel, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> our repenta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, aſſure our ſelves of that point of favour alſo, both becauſe he is a God of ſo great favour towards thoſe that ſeek him, &amp; becauſe that in helping us ſo far already, he hath put us in hope, that he meaneth the full performance of it: &amp; if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinue in his feare, that he will never give us up unto the reproach of any of our enemies whatſoever.</p>

If therefore our true and harty repentance now (upon this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) might procure us ſo great a bleſſing beſides, there is no man but ſeeth, how earneſtly it were to be laboured of us all: both to obtein the thing it ſelf; &amp; to ſave much of that unprofitable labour, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe

For as touching thoſe that receve it,
<note place="margin">Towards thoſe that receave it.</note> we ſee it is in ſuch ſort beſtowed on them, as they are made able therby to <hi>prophecy</hi> &amp; not only al the ſort of them generally, but eſpecially alſo, ſuch as no body would look for, the old &amp; the yo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g, &amp;, that which is moſt, eve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the very <hi>bond-ſlaues</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelves. With ús yet, the elder ſort are too old to learn; &amp; the yonger are over wanton, and care not for it: but the poorer ſort eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally (ſuch as lived before like men, &amp; now by their unmerciful Lords are brought ſo low, that they may rather be accounted bond; then free) are in ſo great and urgent
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:173383:73"/>diſtreſſe, in reſpect of their bodily neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that as they have no hearts unto it, being ſo much overwhelmed with their miſerable eſtate as they are; ſo have they not ſo much as any convenient laiſure, nor comfort neither, to goe about it, would they never ſo fain. It is long there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in the courſe that we are, before that the elder and yonger ſort with ús, and eſpecially thoſe that are ſo fleeſed or ſpoiled by others, will bee able to attaine to the light that nowe is ſpoken of, in ſuch meaſure as here is deſcribed. It were well if they underſtoode (in ſome reaſonable manner) ſuch thinges as were good and needefull for them to know: but to be able to teach others like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that is a point ſo far beyond al like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood for them to attaine unto, that we may rather wiſh it with great doubt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to ſee it; then with hope expect it, as though we might to the full obtaine it, But if we could truly repent us of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ill waies and turne to the Lord, as by this aforeſaide occaſion we may juſtly finde our ſelves provoked to doe, then would the Lord, we neede not to doubt affoord us the ſame meaſure of goodnes
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:173383:73"/>that is promiſed here: then ſhould we all be able to prophecie; our olde men thén would dreame ſuch dreames, our young folke likewiſe would ſee viſions, and the Spirit of God ſhould reſt even on bonds or villains. And ſeeing that alreadie we have, in divers particulars, experience of it (and that in ſo comfortable meaſure, as many have) even thát onely ought to be ſufficient to teach us, that the good work that is alreadie begun, ſhoulde ſoone be perfited, if our ſelves were no hinderance unto it.
<note place="margin">And thoſe that refuſe it.</note> In thoſe things that doe apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to them that refuſe it, we may ſee that it woulde be a ſpeciall bleſſing like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, partly in reſpect of the judgements that belong to the wicked: and partly in reſpect of the ſafety of the faithfull, in the middeſt of all thoſe dangers. In reſpect of the judgements that belong to the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked we may perceave it, if not for that it is ſo noted by the Prophet here: yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that our ſelves alreadie have ſome experience of it. For now alſo may we in ſome meaſure ſee, that ſuch as are diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient unto this mercifull calling of God, are altogether in darkenes, and ſtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſed: and many waies pull downe upon

            <p>And becauſe that already wee ſee, in ſome meaſure this is done, as it is to the glorie of God, that the contempt of his Truth is ſo avenged, before that <hi>great</hi> and <hi>fearefull</hi> day; ſo is it to the ſtrengthening of the weake likewiſe, that thereby perceave, that there is a God whoſe throne is in heaven, and whoſe eyes conſider the children of men: and that he with cheerefull countenance beholdeth the juſt, and raineth on others
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:173383:74"/>ſnares and tempeſts, and many other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of his diſpleaſure, to be unto them a portion to drinke.

Thoſe principall cities were <hi>Tyrus,</hi> and <hi>Zidon,</hi> great Townes of Mart eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the former: the Country was the Lande of <hi>Palestine,</hi> bordering upon them. That which he ſaith unto them is

<pb n="121" facs="tcp:173383:77"/>
               <note n="z" place="margin">3:7, 8.</note> then concerning the puniſhment of it. The better to ſhew forth what their fault was,
<note place="margin">Firſt, as touching their fault.</note> wherewith now he doth charge the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, firſt he ſheweth, that they had no cauſe ſo to doe: then, what it is that they have done. He ſheweth that they had no cauſe ſo to doe, becauſe he will not allow them any ſuch ſpeaches, as whereby they may ſeeme to impart, that they were firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by him: and further telleth them, that if they ſhould ſay ſo, then would he take further order with them. In that he wil not allow them ſuch ſpeaches, we are to note, firſt, what thoſe ſpeaches were, which for that cauſe he ſo rebuketh: then of théir uttering of ſuch like ſpeaches. What thoſe ſpeaches were we may beſt gather in that
<note n="a" place="margin">3:4.</note> the Lord doth aske the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>what they had to do with him:</hi> and whether they would be <hi>avenged on him,</hi> or, as it were, <hi>recompence him,</hi> for ſome hurt that hé before had done them. If they uttered ſuch ſpeaches as theſe (as hereby it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth they did) then did they declare themſelves thereby, both to take in ill part his former chaſtiſement: and now alſo to forget themſelves very far. His former chaſtiſement they did take in ill
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:173383:77"/>part, becauſe they accounted it an hurt unto them, and ſuch as whereon they might juſtly looke to be <hi>avenged.</hi> Now alſo they forget themſelves very far, both becauſe they are ſo ſaw cie, as in ſuch ſort to deale with the Lord: and ſo fooliſh, as to overmatch themſelves ſo farre. In that he would take further order with them we may likewiſe note, both how offenſiue ſuch ſpeaches (or thoughts) are unto him: and what is the order that thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he taketh. That ſuch ſpecahes are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue unto him, he plainely declareth, for that he ſheweth that he will provide further puniſhment for them. The order that hereupon he taketh, is
<note n="b" place="margin">3:4.</note> that he then will be further <hi>avenged</hi> on thém: &amp; that, both very <hi>ſwiftly;</hi> and <hi>upon their heads.</hi> That which they have done, doth partly concerne the ſubſtance or wealth of the la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: &amp; partly the people that dwelt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Concerning the ſubſtance &amp; wealth of the land, he chargeth them both with a wrongfull taking away at the firſt: and with a foule abuſe of it after. That which they wrongfully tooke away,
<note n="c" place="margin">3:5.</note> was firſt, by name, <hi>ſilver and gold:</hi> and then gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, all <hi>precious, or pleaſant</hi> things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:173383:78"/>The abuſe of them after, was that they
<note n="d" place="margin">3:5.</note> carried them into their <hi>Temples:</hi> as though they had got them by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their idols; and offending in this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, that they ſought to advaunce the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of their idols thereby. Concerning the people that dwelt in the land, he chargeth them likewiſe with
<note n="e" place="margin">3:6.</note> double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury againſt them: one, that they did <hi>ſet</hi> them away, and that to the <hi>Graecians,</hi> an heathen people, and far of; the other, that to this end they ſolde them, to ſend them <hi>far from their own border.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Then, as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</note> Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning their puniſhment for this fault, we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, firſt what is the puniſhment that is denounced: then, how the certainty thereof is confirmed. The puniſhment that is denounced, conſiſteth in two pointes: firſt that that which they had done, ſhould be undone againe; then, how their former doings to others, ſhould now be requited in them ſelves. As touching the undoing of that which they had done
<note n="f" place="margin">3:7.</note> he plainly ſaith, that he will <hi>raiſe</hi> the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> out of the place, where they had <hi>ſold</hi> them. As touching the other, that is, howe their former doinges to others, ſhould now be requited in them ſelves,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:173383:78"/>firſt he ſetteth it downe generally: &amp; then more ſpecially. Generally he ſaith that
<note n="g" place="margin">3:7.</note> he will <hi>render their reward</hi> upon their <hi>own head</hi> More ſpecially
<note n="h" place="margin">3:8.</note> he telleth them, both that hé <hi>would ſell</hi> their ſons &amp; their daughters into the hands of the children of Iudah: and that they <hi>ſhould ſell</hi> them over againe unto the <hi>Sabaeans</hi> a farre óf.

And that they have parted the lande of the people of God among them, it appeareth alſo very plainely, in that they had ſo much conſumed them from the face of the earth, and placed them ſelves in their roomes: inſomuch that, of a woorthy and honourable aſſemblie of many good and godly people in the Church of God, they had nowe of late brought it to a diſordered multitude of ſuch a

On the other ſide rather, if once they be known to beare an hoſtile mind againſt us for the Goſpels ſake, and thereupon to lie in waite for ſome opportunitie to break in upon us to their beſt advantage, out of this we may gather, that we might well be ſo voide of all feare of them, as that our ſelves might bid the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> make haſt and ſoone come foorth with the woorſt that they could.

In which reſpect it is not lightly to be paſſed over, that the Lord ſo earneſtly calleth on the beſt ſouldiers, &amp; the moſt valiant warriors that were in the world: and would have no fewer, then áll of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> neither.

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe them in on every ſide: theſe would he have to be a document unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to al others that either then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or where to come, how litle able any power of man ſhould be to praevaile a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the aeternall, and the invincible Truth of God. If they were but of the common ſort of ſouldiers, or if there were but fewe of them, that they could not (to their owne deſire) compaſſe in the other on every ſide, the matter were leſſe, if they could not attaine to that they deſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and though they were foiled or clean overthrowen, yet that alſo were ſhort of

Nay, unleſſe he have them áll, in ſo much that none be wanting, even that alſo is more, then he, in ſuch caſe, can affoord unto them. What cauſe is there then, why we in theſe dayes (when God is diſpoſed, as before wee have heard, to bring againe our captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie) ſhould be ſo afraide when we heare of any, that in this cauſe profeſſe enmitie towardes us: being, as they are, farre ſhort of áll; and, ſuch as they are, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the beſt Warriours themſelves, nor yet ſo ſtrong, though all their forces were united together? But he doth not onely call in their perſons, but putteth them in minde of their furniturealſo: and becauſe their proviſion of weapons might be over ſcant, when now they came all generally, to the end that therin alſo they have no want, he willeth them to frame their inſtruments of husbandry into wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s alſo; that ſo all may be provided ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to the uttermoſt of their owne deſire.

Goliah was a mighty man; very well furniſhed for armour &amp; weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; &amp; an expert ſouldier beſides: and David, on the other ſide, but a ſimple thing to be in the fielde; nothing at all furniſhed to ſuch a purpoſe; &amp; never trained up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. But ſo ſoone as they met, that great beaſt was laid flat on the ground: &amp; Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid went away with his head, for all he could do. Neither is it to be omitted, that the Lord aſſureth of his ſucceſſe, though the odswere ſo great on our enimies part, and the likelihood ſo faire, that even the weaker ſort among them, in hope of the ſpoile, would ſtir up themſelves to goe to the field with the reſt: or at leaſt wiſh, that any way they might be able ſo to do. For whatſoever likelihood there is, that fleſh &amp; blood may thinke to have found: yet can there be no ſooner a triall made, but that it wil moſt plainely appeare, that fleſh &amp; blood was far deceaved. Yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſſe it is to good purpoſe, a ſeemly &amp; a needefull exerciſe to us, that with the Prophet we alſo ſhould in all ſuch gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of earthly forces, lift up our eyes &amp; hearts unto heaven: and there deſire our moſt mighty and mercifull Father, to ſend
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:173383:89"/>downe thoſe greater forces of his, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter with them. Which if we ſhal do, we may likewiſe hope, to have that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and comfortable anſwere, that all the ſortes of óur enemies alſo ſhoulde be gathered together to that diſcomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and irckeſome vallie of Iehoſhaphat to their utter deſtruction: diſcomfortable and irckeſome, I ſay, to all the enemies of the people of God; but unto thoſe that profeſſe the Truth, and ſincerely hold it, a place of great honor and joy, a crowne of glorie, a mountaine of inaeſtimable high renowne, and no vallie at all of grief or reproach.

Can we be ſo ſenſeleſſe or ſo litle touched with the conſideration of theſe calamities, and many others depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereon, that we will not redeeme our ſecuritie from them: when as now the opportunity ſerveth ſo wel; the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſo graciouſly offereth that favour unto us; and we may purchaſe the ſame to our ſelves for litle or nothing? Then muſt we pronounce againſt our ſelves, that we are right worthy to fall to the depth of all diſtreſſe, that ſo litle regard, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo eaſily we may, in time to praeve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it. And how may we looke that God ſhould pity us, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſame we ſhould cry vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:173383:99"/>to him,
<note place="margin">Though we can hardly grow unto it: yet are we not therefore to ſhrinke away from it.</note> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as now we have ſo litle regard thereof our ſelves? Our hearts, I graunt, by the common corruptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of nature, are very hard, and ſtrongly poſſeſſed by the ſinne of impenitencie; and, beſides this, we are ſo diſſolved into all exceſſe, lightnes, and vanity, by the peace and wealth that God hath given us, and for that we have taſted ſo litle of the rod, as now for a good time we have done: that it is leſſe marvaile, if hardly we can growe to any ſuch earneſt and publike ſorrowing; or, ſo much as like of the motion when it is made. But in this caſe alſo it is good to remember, that the wiſedome of a Chriſtian ought to be ſuch, as that whatſoever is an offence or hinderance unto us in the way of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines, though it be as dear, as is our hand, or our foote: yet ought we rather to cut it óf, and caſt it away (though we ſhould be much mained thereby) then that we ſhould ſuffer our ſelves to be let or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred by them. If therefore we have any ſenſe or feeling, of our great &amp; manifold ſins, or of this ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tle hand of God that for the ſame is caſt upon us; if we have any harty deſire to be partakers of thoſe great
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:173383:99"/>and inaeſtimable mercies of God, a more generall, and a further fruition of his ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Truth, and ſo comfortable ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie from all our enemies: what is there then, that, with any colour, may ſtay us, from that which the Prophet doth here require; or, if in heart we conſent unto it, why ſhould not our deede alſo beare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, or rather expreſſe our meaning therein? Well may our dalliance deceave our ſelves: but others it cannot; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, God. The fruites that we beare, will plainely witneſſe what we are. If they be ill, or if they be none, either of thoſe doe plainely caſt us: if they be good (and ſuch as argue a ſounde reverence, and a readie obedience to the Worde of God) then doe we finde, to our ſingular com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, that now in deede we are the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God; and that our reward, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all quaeſtion, muſt needes be great. Long inough have we wallowed in care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les ſecurity; it is time nów to looke about us, &amp; to accept of thoſe more ſpeciall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of God, that he, in this acceptable time of his, doth offer unto us. God give us grace ever to bee eaſie to bee admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:173383:100"/>that he neede not to uſe any rougher meanes to quicken us up: and to take ſuch holde of thoſe good opportunities, that in theſe our daies he offereth unto us, that wee may in like ſort enjoy ſuch bleſſings as are tendered withall.

Our enemies ô Lord have ruled over us very long alreadie: and they of long have done unto ús, even as thoſe others did unto thém. They have taken away our ſilver and golde, and whatſoeuer Iewels we had beſides of ſpirituall graces in Ieſus Chriſt: and thoſe have they carried into the Temples of their owne proper idols, and wickednes aſcribed all unto them. Our ſelves alſo they have not ſpared, but
<pb facs="tcp:173383:102"/>have done with us whatſoever they would. Not onely the boy, but the honourable alſo, and auncient of yeares have they given for an harlot: and not onely the girle, but godlie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, and the chaſt ſoules of thy faithful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have they given for a cup of wine, and for their bellies. And, not ſo content, they have likewiſe in ſuch ſort ſolde us, as moſt might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail them to ſend us away far from our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, that afterwards we ſhould never be able for to returne thither again. But thou, ô Lord thee ſelf haſt ſeene it, and knoweſt well inough, that they have beene ſo greevous unto us, not ſo much for any thing that we had done (though in truth we be moſt wretched ſinners, and have deſerved much more then it) as in deſpight of thy holy Truth, and of an inward hatred to thee. Be it therefore thy gracious pleaſure, to undoe whatſoever they have done: and to gather us together again from all thoſe places, whereinto we were diſperſed by them. And as théy had ſold us a far óf, never to ſee our Countrie again: ſo we beſeech thee, that ſo manie of them, as (in thy ſecret election) belong unto thee, thou alſo would in like maner ſell over, not unto us, but to thy holie Truth, ever to have them in full poſſeſſion, and never

And where as here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore they have alreadie ſo much praevailed againſt thy people: now be it thy pleaſure, to bring them under, and daily more and more to enlarge the ſafetie of thy peculiar people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them all. We graunt, ô Lord, the things we deſire are very great: but it hehooveth thy people ſhould know thy aboundant mercie; and thine enemies alſo the inuincible power of thy mightie hand. Graunt us therefore theſe things we beſeech thee, through Ieſus Chriſt thy Sonne our Lord, to whom with thee and the holie Ghoſt, as of right apperteineth, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed all thankes, honor, and glorie for ever and ever.
